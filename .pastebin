write comprehensive tests using describe in jest for node api and it should cover this description:
The Flow of the web app goes like this, and I want you to use the above structure and write each code where it should be and suggest names of endpoints and mongodb models and instantiate it as it should be: 1. There is a post request that registers a new laptop the request should have the {regNo(number), serialNo(string), brand(string)} for guests the {nationalId(number), serialNo, brand}. There should be a model of computer and a model of user and the app should first check if the user exist in the database using the regNo or if the serialNo is already in the database and take action accordingly. 2. The response to the registration post request should be return a success message with the right http code and a computer registration Id. If there was an error, the user is not in the database or the serialNo is already registered corresponding error messages should be thrown. The computer registration Id will come from an pre-printed qrcode. You will choose the format of the string that should be read on the qrcode and then the string should already be in a kind of database. and match it if it is in that database use if for registration if not return an error response. 3. There should be an endpoint of the GET request to verify the takes a parameter of a computer registration Id and checks the owner of the computer and returns a response that looks like this: {photo link (of the owner), regNo, names, serialNo(of the corresponding computer)} 4. There should be a way to search on the data so that when a query parameter of regNo is passed an array of computers connected with that particular regNo is returned. 5. There should be an endpoint that accepts a PUT request taking this data {regNo(number), serialNo(string), brand(string)} and then check if the computer is there is yes the system will update to a new computer registration Id from a pre-printed qrcode and update the value in the database for the corresponding user.
The computer registration Id for the post and put request should come from the path parameter of the request
